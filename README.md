## How to use prisma

- npx prisma db push
  - This will push models and changes to the database
- npx prisma db pull
  - This will pull models already existing on the database - prisma autogenerates models
- npx prisma generate
  - This will generate the prisma client for us, which allows us to talk to the DB and perform actions
